#    Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#    Do not end the subject line with a period
#    Separate subject from body with a blank line
#    Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#    Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body

# All breaking changes have to be mentioned as a breaking change block in the
# footer, which should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two
# newlines. The rest of the commit message is then the description of the
# change, justification and migration notes.
